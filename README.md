This repository contains the files used for the course project of COMP 7570 in Fall 2020 in University of Manitoba. 
To run this project, follow the following steps:

1. First: run the dbhelper.py ( This will create the database schema and tables for you )
2. Second: run the data_collector.py . Set the variables in the query generation function to your wish. If you want to reduce or increase the wait between requests then just change the variable of waiting time in the code.
3. Run the analyzer.py to run some initial analysis to see if the graph works.
